Do I actually have to kill them via the testicular assault or is it enough to just hit them once with it? I've so far only been hitting them once with it. Is that not enough?Does it have to be on a male character? Saints Row 2 allowed you to get nutshots on women, but the testicular assault wasn't in that game, so I'm unsure if this is a requirement here.",
